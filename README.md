# Verse 1

Little Bunny Foo Foo,
Hopping through the forest,
Scooping up the field mice,
And bopping them on the head.

Down came the Good Fairy, and she said,

"Little Bunny Foo Foo,
I don't want to see you,
Scooping up the field mice
And bopping them on the head."

"I'll give you two more chances,
"I'll give you three chances,
And if you don't behave,
I'm gonna turn you into a goon!"
